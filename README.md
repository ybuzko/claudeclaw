<p align="center"><b>A lightweight, open-source OpenClaw version built into your Claude Code.</b></p>

ClaudeClaw turns your Claude Code into a personal assistant that never sleeps. It runs as a background daemon, executing tasks on a schedule, responding to messages on Telegram, Discord, and Slack, transcribing voice commands, and integrating with any service you need.

> Note: Please don't use ClaudeClaw for hacking any bank system or doing any illegal activities. Thank you.

## Why ClaudeClaw?

| Category | ClaudeClaw | OpenClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic Will Come After You | No | Yes |
| API Overhead | Directly uses your Claude Code subscription | Nightmare |
| Setup & Installation | ~5 minutes | Nightmare |
| Deployment | Install Claude Code on any device or VPS and run | Nightmare |
| Isolation Model | Folder-based and isolated as needed | Global by default (security nightmare) |
| Reliability | Simple reliable system for agents | Bugs nightmare |
| Feature Scope | Lightweight features you actually use | 600k+ LOC nightmare |
| Security | Average Claude Code usage | Nightmare |
| Cost Efficiency | Efficient usage | Nightmare |
| Memory | Uses Claude internal memory system + `CLAUDE.md` | Nightmare |

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add moazbuilds/claudeclaw
claude plugin install claudeclaw
```
Then open a Claude Code session and run:
```
/claudeclaw:start
```
The setup wizard walks you through model, heartbeat, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and security, then your daemon is live with a web dashboard.

### Contributor Note: Plugin Version Metadata

If you change shipped plugin files under `src/`, `commands/`, `prompts/`, or `.claude-plugin/`, the plugin metadata version may also need to be bumped so Claude Code and marketplace consumers detect the update correctly.

Helpers:

```bash
bun run bump:plugin-version
bun run bump:marketplace-version
```

Docs-only and other non-shipped changes do not require these bumps.

## Upgrading

### v1.0.26 — Allowlist behavior change (Telegram & Discord)

Prior to this release, an empty `allowedUserIds` list meant **allow everyone**. That was a potential security vulnerability; any Telegram or Discord user could drive the daemon.

**New behavior:** an empty list means **block everyone**. The daemon will refuse to start if a bot token is configured without at least one allowed user ID.

**Migration:** add your user ID(s) to `settings.json` before upgrading:

```json
"telegram": { "allowedUserIds": [123456789] },
"discord":  { "allowedUserIds": ["987654321012345678"] }
```

Run `claudeclaw config` for guided setup if you're unsure of your user ID.

### v1.1.0 — Web UI bearer token gate

All `/api/*` routes (except `/api/health`) now require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The token is auto-generated on first start and written to `.claude/claudeclaw/web.token`. The daemon also prints the full URL with the token embedded when the web UI starts.

**Migration:** update any scripts that call `/api/state` or other API routes to pass the token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <contents of .claude/claudeclaw/web.token>
```

Existing `/api/inject` users who configured `settings.apiToken` are unaffected; that fallback still works.

The blocking `POST /api/inject` response includes `usage`. Its token counts and per-model
`requests` come from assistant records appended to the Claude session transcript during the
queued turn, deduplicated by `requestId` (first record wins). `basis: "transcript"` identifies
those per-turn totals. If the transcript cannot be read, `basis: "result_json"` flags a
potentially cumulative result JSON estimate; `requests: 0` then means the per-turn request count
is unknown. `session` contains cumulative `costUsd`, `numTurns`, and `durationApiMs` when Claude
reports them. Multiple transcript-backed attempts in one turn are summed; mixed or unavailable
attempts retain the final readable estimate with `basis: "result_json"`. `usage` is `null` when
no usage source is readable.

### v1.1.0 — Discord text-attachment truncation limit reduced

Text attachments sent to the Discord bot are now truncated at **2,048 bytes** (previously 51,200). Payloads over that limit have `…[truncated]` appended silently; there is no config knob to restore the old limit.

**Migration:** if you rely on passing large text files through Discord attachments, switch to gists or another file-sharing mechanism and paste the URL instead.

## Features

### Automation
- **Heartbeat:** Periodic check-ins with configurable intervals, quiet hours, and editable prompts.
- **Cron Jobs:** Timezone-aware schedules for repeating or one-time tasks with reliable execution.

### Communication
- **Telegram:** Text, image, and voice support.
- **Discord:** DMs, server mentions/replies, slash commands, voice messages, and image attachments.
- **Slack:** Socket Mode bot — DMs, channel mentions, threads, voice messages, and file attachments. Configure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in your environment or `settings.json`.
- **Time Awareness:** Message time prefixes help the agent understand delays and daily patterns.

### Multi-Session Threads (Discord)
- **Independent Thread Sessions:** Each Discord thread gets its own Claude CLI session, fully isolated from the main channel.
- **Parallel Processing:** Thread conversations run concurrently — messages in different threads don't block each other.
- **Auto-Create:** First message in a new thread automatically bootstraps a fresh session. No setup needed.
- **Session Cleanup:** Thread sessions are automatically cleaned up when threads are deleted or archived.
- **Backward Compatible:** DMs and main channel messages continue using the global session.

See [docs/MULTI_SESSION.md](docs/MULTI_SESSION.md) for technical details.

### Reliability and Control
- **GLM Fallback:** Automatically continue with GLM models if your primary limit is reached.
- **Web Dashboard:** Manage jobs, monitor runs, and inspect logs in real time.
- **Security Levels:** Four access levels from read-only to full system access.
- **Model Selection:** Switch models based on your workload.

## FAQ

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Can ClaudeClaw do &lt;something&gt;?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    If Claude Code can do it, ClaudeClaw can do it too. ClaudeClaw adds cron jobs,
    heartbeats, and Telegram/Discord/Slack bridges on top. You can also give your ClaudeClaw new
    skills and teach it custom workflows.
  </p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Is this project breaking Anthropic ToS?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    No. ClaudeClaw is local usage inside the Claude Code ecosystem. It wraps Claude Code
    directly and does not require third-party OAuth outside that flow.
    If you build your own scripts to do the same thing, it would be the same.
  </p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Will Anthropic sue you for building ClaudeClaw?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I hope not.
  </p>
</details>

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Are you ready to change this project name?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    If it bothers Anthropic, I might rename it to OpenClawd. Not sure yet.
